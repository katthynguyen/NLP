 Creation myths from other religions see the universe arise from conjuring tricks sculpture drunken conflicts chance or accidents
 Every culture has a myth of how the earth was made and human life began
 It is almost impossible visually to address the question Why are we here said Neil MacGregor former director of the British Museum and author of the book Living with the Gods
 But if a religion has representational art then Creation will everywhere be a major theme
 The best known example is arguably Michelangelo s painted ceiling in the Vatican s Sistine Chapel depicting Creation as told in the Book of Genesis said MacGregor which culminates in the giving of life to the first human Adam
Audiences and academics have long asked if Michelangelo a polymath with excellent knowledge of human anatomy hid a more human shape in his masterpiece the outline of a brain or a uterus containing a placenta depending on interpretation
 If true this depiction follows in the line of a long tradition going back to early ancestor figures and goddesses of fertility mixing images of supernatural creation with the ongoing miracle of human life
Even religions without representational art have strived to illustrate Creation
 In Islam where only the word can be represented there are beautiful calligraphies of God s word Be by which Adam the first human was given life said MacGregor

 Early religion art and literature were inextricable from the nature we lived among
Only later the theoretical divide between nature and culture starts to emerge in the thoughts of certain civilizations
 While Western art has long been fascinated with nature the dominant trends to emerge in Western tradition put humanity and nature in separate spheres
 Understanding nature and the human relation to it the world s great religious traditions and traditions of philosophy differ explained Karl Kusserow co author of the book Nature s Nation American Art and Environment
 And many of them in ways we re coming to realize are more ecologically sound and sustainable than the one that the West has evolved
 Understanding nature and the human relation to it the world s great religious traditions and traditions of philosophy differ Karl Kusserow author of Nature s Nation Europeans painted detailed images of natural species to categorise them for science or else represented them as god given landscapes eternal and unchanging
 Meanwhile Buddhist Aboriginal Australian and Native American art each depicted humans as part of nature
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century up to the current age of the Anthropocene large scale man made damage to the environment has forced both Western and non Western artists to rethink
 The problem is that if you don t see yourself as part of something you don t tend to care for it very well which is exactly what we ve done

Yet artists have rarely crossed the line to producing accurate portraits of regular individuals worthy of standing apart alongside leaders saints and gods
 In the Venetian Republic they didn t allow portraits of individuals in public spaces because they didn t want individuals to assert themselves at the expense of the Republic explained James Hall the author of The Self Portrait A Cultural History
 There have often been controls of the diffusion of portraiture
 Self portraits are rarer still
 Only Europeans developed a prevalent tradition of self portraiture before the 19th century said Hall
European societies traditionally had a preoccupation with the individual and individuality in contrast with other cultures that emphasize the collective and communal
But in the greatest self portraits we see more than an accurate copy of a person s appearance Hall explains
 Whether naturalistic or not we see the material spiritual and cultural society the artist inhabits and their place in it
 The self portrait becomes the microcosm those are the most interesting ones said Hall

 But art history reveals an ongoing and intimate connection between base desires of power and the objects of human creativity
Among the earliest objects in the Louvre Abu Dhabi is a razor thin stone blade
 It is the work of a 20 000 year old craftsperson whose technical skill had elevated the practice of toolmaking responsible for early humans dominion over nature to an art form
Art and power have been connected from the very start according to Paola Rapelli author of the book Symbols of Power in Art which connects the ancient reliefs of Assyrian palaces towering Roman statues renaissance painting and contemporary photojournalism depicting military conflicts
 The population is easily captured by the impressive image of power said Rapelli
 While the symbols and artistic language used to project power vary between cultures many attempt to reflect the sources of legitimate power described by the ancient Greeks physical strength popular approbation wisdom virtue and sovereignty

 The earliest objects in the Louvre Abu Dhabi precede the beginnings of organized Islam Christianity Judaism Buddhism or Hinduism and represent a time of early faith when belief in gods and spirits mixed with the mysteries of the natural world animals the sun and the moon and the great unknown
 Every human culture that has a sense of the divine has felt compelled in one way or another to create form sometimes as metaphor sometimes symbol sometimes as in Islamic traditions by eschewing mimesis by favoring abstraction said Deborah Lewer a senior lecturer in the history of art at the University of Glasgow
Since the beginnings art and faith have developed side by side across the world with artists and artisans finding inspiration in religious belief and expressing their greatest gifts in honour of gods
 Every human culture that has a sense of the divine has felt compelled in one way or another to create form Deborah Lewer University of GlasgowBut depictions of the divine are anything but simple expressions of something beyond humanity
 All these messy things to do with power wealth and status are also involved explained Lewer
 If you look at the works of the Italian Renaissance some of the greatest works of religious art that we admire and feel moved by would not be there were it not for the desire of their patrons to express their own wealth and power and status
 I think they are best seen in many cases as traces of human beings trying to understand the world the divine and humanity s place in it and that is what many of these works of art are

 As in most civilizations political power and faith mixed in Ancient Egypt
 Osiris the son of the gods Geb earth and Nut sky was believed to be the first Pharaoh on earth
 This provided the divine basis for the pharaohs right to rule
 Osiris often represented with a green or black complexion colors that signify rebirth and the fertile lands of the Nile was worshiped as the fair judge of the afterlife
 But this funerary statue would have initially appeared here as shining bronze said Noëmi Daucé chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 Afterlife is the main preoccupation and it s not really afterlife but reaching eternity and ensuring nothing neither your name nor your body is affected by death so that you can reach eternity after this trial facing Osiris
 Osiris is usually portrayed in a shroud with arms crossed as if in burial but eyes half open
 Ancient Egyptian culture developed funerary rituals of unprecedented originality and complexity
 We try to highlight the connection the exchanges the encounters between civilizations
 But we try not to underestimate the originality and uniqueness of expression artistic and cultural of civilizations said Daucé

 Depictions of Shiva responsible for the cyclical destruction of the universe are extremely varied
 In Hinduism this periodic destruction which comes at the end of a cosmic cycle is not seen as a disaster to be avoided but rather a process that allows for re creation putting an end to ignorance and guiding the world to enlightenment
 In this bronze sculpture from Tamil Nadu at the southern tip of India Shiva appears in one of his most popular guises as Lord of the Dance with four arms
 It is crushing a small human shaped being with the right foot as a symbol of ignorance said Guilhem André chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
Shiva is associated with extremes of emotion that can include joy as well fierce violence and he is often depicted as a father and husband as well as closely connected with the world of nature
 This well known image of Shiva would have been involved in celebrations of the God and of harmony said André It would be carried on processions in the street

 It is the time when the Gautama Buddha was said to be spiritually awakened through meditation beneath the Bodhi Tree and have gained insight that became central teachings of Buddhism
 The knowledge of the true nature of the world is said to free humans from the cycle of suffering death and rebirth that characterises unenlightened life
 According to some accounts four weeks after he began meditation a rainstorm began and Mucalinda a serpent king wound itself around the Buddha and sheltered him with its hood
In Cambodia this image of man and naturalistic spirit beast became a popular symbol
 The representation of royal ornaments emphasises the idea of the Buddha being distinguished from ordinary mortals and reveals him to the faithful as the ruler of the spiritual realm write curators

 Although the image depicts the Christian Messiah as a newborn it is heavily laden with symbolism of his destiny dying to redeem humanity for its sins
 The infant Jesus hand rests on a book symbolizing his already written fate and Mary is shown dressed in red a color traditionally associated with the Passion the short final period in the life of Jesus before his crucifixion
 The image which invites the viewer to pray was of a type commonly found in the homes of wealthy Christian adherents during this time
This is one of three depictions of this type of scene displayed in a collection at the Louvre Abu Dhabi including a painting by Francesco Traini from the early Italian Renaissance and a work by an unknown artist from 15th or 16th century Greece
 Over time the paintings become more complex and more recognisably humane You see that there is a clear evolution on this topic between the Greek and Byzantine way of representing this scene in the early Renaissance period with the Primitive Italian painters and then what is happening at the end with Bellini said Guilhem André chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 It is the tenderness of course which is getting more and more developed through time and through different paintings that we have on display in our gallery

 The Louvre Abu Dhabi displays a 19th century wooden statuette from Gabon holding a similar pose and more than 4 000 years older still a marble woman from Greece and alabaster figure from Syria from the third millennium BC all bowed hands touching
 This painting by Rembrandt van Rijn the most celebrated Dutch artist of the 17th century displays the pose as a key symbol of Christian devotion
 But the artist hints at something more
 Likely painted from life as a sketch for a painting of a young Jesus it displays the psychological depth and torpors of emotion for which the Dutch artist is praised
 It also demonstrates the great Master s understanding of the fragility and intense spirituality of life which inspired so many artists after him said Dr
 Souraya Noujaim management director of the Louvre Abu Dhabi s collection
The image may have been intended to portray a famous biblical event known as the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane according to Sotheby s
 Following the Last Supper Jesus prays aware that he will soon be betrayed by one of his followers and may soon face death
 Jesus appears here not as a powerful leader but as a human deep in prayer
 The austere scene reflected its social context during the Dutch Golden Age a period of economic growth in the Netherlands when religious art declined relative to more grounded everyday scenes still lifes and landscapes painted with increasing realism

 The burekalou was usually the grandest dwelling in the village in many cases even bigger than the chief s house according to the Museum of New Zealand
 Temples in Fiji were built with tall towers so that priests prayers could reach the gods
 Portable shrines such as this one were designed as miniaturised versions of the temples which priests took with them when they travelled
 Made from intricately woven coconut fibre these provided a portable home for spirits to inhabit so that they could remain close to the priests who were the only people who provided for them
At the Louvre Abu Dhabi the shrine is displayed along with other houses of the dead urns and containers for relics designed to look like miniature buildings
 The house of the dead resembles that of the living
 Why keep the deceased with us ask the curators
 The living need the dead in order to inscribe their short lives into the long history of their community
 They listen to their ancestors telling them stories talking about the country teaching them how to live and die
 In Polynesian society priests communicated prayers from regular people to gods
 If prayers were seen to have failed such as in the case of a natural disaster priests would be held responsible and it could cost them their lives according to the Polynesian Cultural Centre

The curators explain that we know for certain that this handcraft gave birth to arts such as a 20 000 year old blade found in France which is displayed nearby in the museum
 Too thin to be used to cut the perfectly symmetrical blade in the shape of laurel leaf demonstrates a high level of skill and some ceremonial or symbolic purpose
 In these geometrical bi face axes we see the earliest representation of human power in objects designed by our common ancestor to elevate itself above nature and the beginnings of human culture laid out in the rest of the museum

 Coins bearing the head of a political leader and were among the earliest mass communicated images of a living person while others spread symbols of cities and empires economic strength
 Alexander the Great one of the most successful military leaders in world history minted inumerable coins during his life which circulated far beyond his native Macedonia
 While some bore his face others showed the mythic hero Heracles which led many to mistakenly associate the image of the legendary demi god with Alexander himself
This coin bears an image of Heracles wearing a headdress made from the pelt of the Nemean Lion a fearsome beast that Heracles was said to have slayed
 These silver coins were larger denominations than the bronze coins that were used in the marketplace and were originally paid to mercenaries involved in Alexander s conquests which stretched from northwestern India to northeast Africa
 At the Louvre Abu Dhabi coins minted by Alexander and his father Philip are displayed alongside coins from as far apart as modern day France and the United Arab Emirates
 Although the territories of the Parisii in Gaul were separated from the kingdom of Abi el in the United Arab Emirates by almost 7 000 kilometres the coins of the two powers resemble one another extraordinarily with their stylised and schematised head of Heracles Alexander write curators

 It is one of a group of such helmets made in Persia and Anatolia modern day Iran and Turkey respectively between the 14th and 16th century
 This example has a steel chainmail lower part below an inscription which speaks of allegiance to an emperor called the shadow of God
 On the twisted steel and silver dome another inscription inspired by the mysticism of Sufi Islam speaks of belief in God and modesty of material desires
 This marriage of creative inscription with weaponry and armor was common among adherents of Sufism seeking a symbol of spiritual power of protection said Rose Marie Mousseaux chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 This inscription is completely connected with this Sufi way of life putting these kinds of words this kind of motto exactly at the core of the weapon said Mousseaux
While helmets like these were worn in combat this helmet was likely saw no military action and was used for ceremonial purposes
 A dramatic plume of feathers would have sprouted from the top Imagine the impression with all these elements and all this ornamentation with a feather at the top said Mousseaux
 It is a masterpiece of weaponry
 In the 19th century it came into the possession of Jean Léon Gérôme one of the leading figures in the Western discovery of the Islamic arts and was shown in a 1903 exhibition in Paris

 From the 11th century the walled city was an architectural marvel paved with terracotta and decorated with mosaic
 At the centre of the city the palace of the Oba the ruler was highly decorated with bronze and terracotta sculptures
 This sculpture showing an ancestor of the Oba likely praised in a form of ancestor worship was once part of a more complex iconographical system along with bronzes showing scenes of daily life said Rose Marie Mousseaux chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 Another bronze on display at the museum shows the Oba with two warriors beside him and two musicians depicted much smaller
 It s interesting to compare these two approaches
 You have here civil life the daily life not of all the population but of the Oba and the King s entourage and you have in the head the ancestors of the Royal Family said Mousseaux
Between the 15th and 18th century Benin became key to the Portuguese and Dutch trade with West Africa in gold and ivory as well as slaves
 The kingdom of Benin stood until 1897 when British imperial forces razed Benin City then the center of the kingdom in a punishing attack which resulted in the loss of thousands of artworks collectively known as the Benin Bronzes
 The present Oba and the ethnic Yoruba descendents of Benin have lobbied for years for the return of treasures such as this which are currently held by the British Museum and institutions across the world

 Bernard Pass in May 1800
 The historical event formed part of Napoleon s reconquest of land in Italy that had been lost to Austrian forces
 It shows a highly dramatized and idealized version of events encouraged by Napoleon s belief that communicating political and military heroism was more important than historical accuracy
 This image depicts an episode before Napoleon became emperor but it was made after he received the crown of the emperor said Rose Marie Mousseaux chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 In it we see the way biographical history is built through paintings she adds
In reality Napoleon did not lead his troops through savage weather at the time of the crossing but followed them in pleasant spring sunlight on a mule
 David s depiction quickly became an influential image of French nationalism with copies appearing on stamps and posters and signified the re emergence of France as a European power following the French revolution of 1789 99
 The writing at the base places Napoleon s name next to other European military leaders famous for leading armies across the same mountain range many centuries before Hannibal and Charlemagne with the clear intention of telling readers that Napoleon s conquest marked a new chapter in the legacy of such historic figures according to Mousseaux

 In Egypt the Nile was essential to local ecosystems in an otherwise arid landscape
 For ancient civilizations it was central to survival washing ashore fertile soils in the river s yearly floods
 Curators at the Louvre Abu Dhabi explained this ceramic hippo covered in aquatic plants is a symbol of rebirth that was placed in the tomb of an important dignitary during Egypt s Middle Kingdom around 2030 1650 BCE 
As both the source of agricultural wealth and a mortal danger the Nile flooding elicited an ambivalent response from ancient Egyptians said Noëmi Daucé chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 The river and the hippopotamus were both a threat and a blessing
 This story of a valuable river ecosystem inspiring religious and cultural belief is not unique to Egypt
 We ve chosen to illustrate the benefits of the Nile river but it could have been in Mesopotamia the Tigris and the Euphrates or the Yellow River in China 
 The idea is to highlight the importance of these ecosystems that first spurred the development of huge civilizations in antiquity

 Nevertheless the more than 2000 year old chimeric animal is distinguished by the extreme naturalistic accuracy of its body such as the appearance of muscles and ligature beneath the skin
 If you see it in the gallery you see all the movement and the dynamism of this dragon said Noëmi Daucé chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 It seems like he is just about to jump to fly as if all the muscles were ready for this big impact
 The exact use of this bronze statue unusually large at around 70cm in length is unknown
 But it is among the first large scale representations of a hybrid animal in China according to Daucé
 It was likely influenced by the country s neighbors the semi nomadic peoples of Central Asia whose culture frequently features such chimeric animals
 The knowledge of these animal rearing and hunting cultures inspired this zoomorphic depiction of a dragon a mythical beast that had for centuries been an important symbol of good fortune and fertility in China
 It s an artistic expression in movement always in movement said Daucé
 Starting from an anatomical description it s going towards something that is more poetic

 The animals appear in cave paintings in France that date back more than 30 000 years among the oldest figurative artworks still in existence
 The lion is one of the most universal symbols of strength courage and power said Guilhem André chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 This 73cm tall one is decorated with Arabic inscriptions and other natural imagery a mythical griffin is seen on the front leg a parrot and bird of prey on the rear legs against plant motifs
 It consists of one of the most important medieval works in the Islamic tradition from the Mediterranean area said André
The sculpture is surrounded by an air of mystery as its exact origin age and purpose are unknown and only a couple of similar sculptures still exist like the Pisa Griffin and the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra Spain explained André
 Originally the face of the Mari Cha lion would have been decorated with the contrasting colours of enamel or ivory
 It features a realistic nose but an otherwise stylized face with wide open eyes and a peculiar tubular mouth opening
 This mouth was believed to have been a fountain or incense burner
 A more recent study however has shown that the lion may have been a mechanical toy with a mechanism in the body that would produce a roaring sound

 The rugged peninsula in the north of France was seen at the time by artists in Gauguin s circle as a conservatory of ancestral traditions such as traditional folk wrestling according to the Musee D Orsay in Paris
 While French cities were undergoing rapid industrialization and change Gauguin sought out areas he saw as remote unspoiled and savage said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 Gauguin wrote to a friend I love Brittany
 I find a certain wildness and primitiveness here
 When my clogs resound on this granite soil I hear the dull matt powerful tone I seek in my painting
 This pursuit eventually led him to the South Pacific where he painted many of his most famous works which controversially depicted local cultures in primitive images
 The industrial revolutions of the 19th century unleashed environmental change and led many Western artists to view nature not as eternal and separate from human action but threatened by modern civilization
 This was also the time of the Meiji Era a period of rapid modernization in Japan when European artists first became aware of Japanese prints with bright colors and a radically different flat appearance
 It was such a shock for artists of this time said Singer
 Prints of sumo wrestlers influenced Gauguin s subtly violent image she added

 In his images of nature Lam painted slave worked plantations ancestral African traditions occult and Catholic beliefs
 Lam first visited the island of Martinique in 1941 returning to Cuba full of inspiration from the lush forests and a meeting with poet Aimé Césaire who encouraged Lam s artistic exploration of his own African heritage
In Havana Lam created a new Cuban art that reflected both his own background and the Afro Cuban traditions while challenging the European dominated Cuban society said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 He aimed to paint the drama of my country but by thoroughly expressing the Negro spirit he wrote In this way I could act as a Trojan horse that would spew forth hallucinating figures with the power to surprise to disturb the dreams of the exploiters

 It has this tension between nature and culture said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi

 So it s a symbol of life shared universally by all cultures as the artist says
 It s something very beautiful and it was another symbol for the birth of the new museum growing like knowledge and going toward the light

 It was discovered in 1983 near Amman the capital of Jordan along with more than 30 similar monuments each carefully made from bundles of reeds covered with plaster
 All statues discovered some with one head others with two have the same arresting stare with disproportionately wide eyes carefully outlined in black bitumen
 In each they have the uncanny appearance both as a familiar human being but also un human or deceased What they express is probably some of the first beliefs of these ancient villagers or communities of agriculture said Noëmi Daucé chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
More than 8 000 years ago the statues were laid in two carefully prepared pits and buried
 However little is known about why they began producing these models likely for public display only to bury them soon after
 At the same site human skulls also covered in plaster were found likely evidence of a cult of ancestor worship according to Daucé
 As farming was developed moving people into stationary homes on the land such monuments of humans real or mythical may have played a role in consolidating power creating seasonal rituals and developing early society

 However it left no written records or portraits only many masks showing human faces
 In the 20th century this particular mask came into the possession of the Mexican painter Diego Rivera 1886 1957 
 It appears in one of the works of Rivera s partner Frida Kahlo 1907 1954 My Nurse and I from 1937
 Kahlo s work considers the open questions posed by this ancient mask of the identity of the face and its maker whether this mask was modeled as a realistic depiction of a certain individual or a class of people in Teotihuacan society and why it was produced
 It was probably part of a larger figure
 Whether it represents a specific category of human we do not know said Noëmi Daucé chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
In My Nurse and I the mask covers the face of a woman who breastfeeds a baby Kahlo making reference to the artist s indigenous heritage
 The Mexican mask ended up influencing the development of the surrealist aesthetic when Rivera gave it to the surrealist artist André Breton
 Curators at the Louvre Abu Dhabi hope to emphasize the sometimes overlooked quality of pre Columbian artistic output It highlights the huge quality of artistic production in Teotihuacan civilization that was on the same level as the Han Empire or the Roman Empire said Daucé

 Rodin conceived the sculpture originally just 70cm tall as part of an elaborate doorway named The Gates of Hell intended for the Decorative Arts Museum in Paris
 The intricate door frame told the story of Dante s Inferno from the Divine Comedy which describes the poet s travels through hell purgatory and heaven
 The figure was intended to represent the writer Dante Alighieri leaning forward to observe the circles of hell while meditating on his work according to the Musee Rodin
 It was Dante but we wonder if it is not also a self portrait of himself said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
Rodin himself explained he originally planned a clothed Dante but the idea progressed to bear little relation to the Italian poet
 Instead it has been interpreted as a universal figure depicting a person in thought on the cusp of action The fertile thought slowly elaborates itself within his brain
 He is no longer dreamer he is creator wrote Rodin
 Once it moved away from that big Gates of Hell it became one of the most known sculptures because every person can look at it and understand what it is about said Singer
 Here at original size rather than the monumental size it would be reproduced at The Thinker is more human
 We can see the spine and back It s almost fragile you can almost hear him breathe said Singer

 Klein used the bodies of models as living paintbrushes guiding them to create monochrome paintings in a particular pigment he had patented known as International Klein Blue
 The body and the soul is one in a print said Rotraut Klein Moquay Klein s wife and collaborator
 Klein directed his performances in bow tie and jacket serving blue cocktails and conducting an orchestra to perform his Monotone Silence Symphony a D major chord played for 20 minutes followed by 20 minutes of silence 
The Anthropometries series resulted in dozens of works completed shortly before Klein s early death aged 34 in 1962
 This painting ANT 110 is a rarity among Klein s works because it featured a man and woman
 It is the only one I know of the artist Yves Klien himself and his wife said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 I think it s very moving because it s like a self portrait for a couple
 When you look at it it s like a chromosome like a helix or something that is very linked to DNA of the body
 Or something from old caves something very primitive but powerful also

 That allowed him to put all his energy that vital force into that painting said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 In the 1960s many artists including Yves Klein were also experimenting with using the body as a paintbrush
 Yet Shiraga prefigured many Western peers
 He was a member of Japan s Gutai concrete art movement founded in 1956 which explored contact often brutal between the artist s body and the material
In this work he achieved an intense expression of his own body and spiritual energy using vivid color and violent movement to capture all of his action and energy in his work said Singer
 Across many cultures this combination of red and black has associations with danger and violence
 Shiraga who was not internationally recognized until after his death saw the performance of his painting as integral to the work
 I want to paint as though rushing around a battlefield exerting myself to collapse from exhaustion he wrote in 1955

 Twombly was influenced by painters like Jackson Pollock said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 Pollock communicated feeling not by painting evocative objects and scenes but through his unique ways of applying paint to canvas dribbling flicking or smearing
 Similarly Twombly saw his pseudo writing as a form of calligraphy without words
 This was one of the final works produced by Twombly before his death in 2011 and he was likely reflecting on his life and the history of human artistry said Singer all the way back to the French cave paintings that fascinated him
 He was very inspired by the first graffiti the first signs humans put in the cave said Singer
This work acts to tell the story of his life but one that through its gestures connects Twombly with countless artists before added Singer It s the gesture of a painter to feel the connection to the painters from those very early times to now
 It was part of a series the artist called Notes from Salalah a kind of diary from the city of Salalah in southern Oman a place that Twombly had never visited but whose lush greenery is linked with the vibrant color of the painting

 Across the world divided by thousands of miles and by millenia similar totems were often produced to coincide with the development of the early agricultural settlements
 In each case we associate their shape and emphasized breasts and hips with femininity and fertility
 This figure however made of chlorite and calcite minerals is set apart by its complexity and intricacy
This god was reproduced on drinking goblets and pins
 She is always associated with animals and not random animals but wild and dangerous animals such as lions snakes eagles said Noëmi Daucé chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 So the latest interpretation is that she s probably controlling the wider world and nature
 She would be the major deity in the area between Uzbekistan Tajikistan and Afghanistan
 Daucé said there are other similar statuettes but this one is considered a masterpiece even though it has likely lost a metal necklace and lapis lazuli decorations
 It reflects a significant development in religious thought beyond the other simpler female figures researchers believe she is a god who reigns at the top of a complex pantheon of gods and spirits and watches over the all important cycle of nature

 In the mythology of the Dogon people of central Mali humans are born with both sexes and are differentiated between male and female in life
 This figure is believed to have been made by earlier pre Dogon people but shares the later civilization s representation of people of dual sex
 This question of sexual duality and separation permeates Dogon culture
 The Dogon creator god Amma is of dual sex and holds the world protectively in its hands
 Figures of this type are still very present in Dogon iconography and mythology say the museum s curators where they figure in the initiation rites of adolescents
A large amount is known about the Dogon due to studies in the 1940s by French anthropologist Marcel Griaule
 Among the group s traditional beliefs in ancestor worship spirits and other supernatural beings Griaule recorded that they believed they had been visited by reptilian people from the star Sirius
 Rather than drawing attention to these particular beliefs the museum hoped to draw attention to how early African statuary represented eclectic myths said Guilhem André chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 For us it is a way of presenting the diversity of religion at this early period and also the art that was created in these different contexts

 In its most basic form it depicts the Virgin Mary the mother of Jesus with her infant on her knee
 The scene has provided a versatile image that communicated both private religious devotion and the intimate human connection between mother and child
 Francesco Traini an artist from Pisa renders the image with gentle emotional connection between mother and child which contrasts with earlier depictions that more often emphasized the holiness of the figures
 What is interesting in this painting is the gaze of adoration that is very clear said Guilhem André chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
The painting belongs to a tradition now known as Italian primitive paintings dating to the pre Renaissance and early Italian Renaissance eras and has a gilded background that arrived from the art of the Byzantine Empire explained André
 The composition of the mother cradling the child has been an influential motif in Western art which developed significantly through the Renaissance and continues to be reproduced in secular art and contemporary photography

 A powerful set of symbolic events in religious texts involve light communicating divinity and revelation
 This begins with the Creation in the book of Genesis part of both the Torah and Bible which is announced with God s statement Let there be light
 In the Islamic world particular importance is attached to light as one of the 99 names of Allah al Nur explains the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 Each of these religions have developed objects and artworks that reflect this symbolism including the Jewish Menorah and Christian stained glass windows
 In Islam mosque lamps were produced in great numbers in the 13th and 14th Centuries to illuminate mosques and religious complexes explain curators
 The glass that is used for this mosque lamp is also used for the stained glass of the Christians said Guilhem André chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
Both glass and glass working techniques passed along trade routes Since the early period glass is also a good that was very much traded between civilizations
 This lamp around 25 cm tall and produced by Syrian or Egyptian glassworkers was originally scattered with gold dust to produce a sparkling light to represent the divine light that Allah the creator of everything in existence according to Islam shines on the universe
 The enamelled glass bears the name of its donor Emir Tankizbugha a senior royal official

 For Paris based Indian artist Sayed Haider Raza whose work draws on both European and South Asian art history the bindu is a versatile motif with meanings derived from Hinduism representing life and the seed of creation as well as appearing as a great void or geometric motif in abstract art
 Bindu could look very simple that black dot
 But it is almost something perfect it has that connection to the cosmos to birth to the very end death said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 The simple circle becomes something totally open very enigmatic but also familiar
 When you look at it you have the feeling that it s coming towards your eyes and you re floating in the cosmos and time
 Raza who moved to france in 1950 reinterprets this traditional symbol through the prism of Western abstract art
 Artists like Piet Mondrian and later Mark Rothko were preoccupied with colour texture and space and Raza draws on this legacy said Singer
 It s very interesting the way artists coming from a different context keep that heritage and transform it into something connected to the whole art history but still have their own approach
 The large black circle in the center is set amid orange blocks with a glowing orange ring making an engrossing image of life somehow emanating from the darkness

 One of the texts belongs to a Mesopotamian tablet and tells the story of the creation of mankind in the ancient languages of Acadian and Sumerian
 Another comes from the Muqaddimah an account of human history by the 14th century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun
 The last in French was taken from Renaissance writer Michel de Montaigne s Essais
 Holzer has worked with words for four decades
 Her choices of French and Arab texts echo the Franco Emirati partnership of the museum and she told the Art Newspaper she hoped the work would act as a mysterious creation myth for the museum itself
 It is very poetic and very moving said Juliette Singer chief curator at the Louvre Abu Dhabi
 Inscribing messages in stone raises the question of what information and messages we are transmitting to the next generation said Singer and the languages speak of a dialogue between communities
 It can also be an allegory for the museum itself coming from antiquity until now
 It s like we have a direct bridge between times between continents
